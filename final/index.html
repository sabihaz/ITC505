    <h2>Project Addendum</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The primary challenge was ensuring the starting configuration was both random and solvable. This was resolved by simulating random user clicks on a solved board to guarantee solvability.</li>
        <li>Creating a visually appealing design required experimenting with CSS for responsiveness, hover effects, and consistent grid alignment.</li>
        <li>Ensuring the JavaScript code was modular and reusable for features like toggling tiles and checking the game state took significant refactoring.</li>
        <li>Testing edge cases, such as clicking tiles on the board's edges or corners, helped refine the toggle logic for neighbors.</li>
        <li>Incorporating a seamless "Last Modified" footer without disrupting other game functions required careful placement of the script.</li>
